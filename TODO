TODO:
* Nice textual display of info for a quake.
* Pretty glowing OPENGL bars or mounds coming up out of each quake.
* Hook into the USGS's ground shake maps ... display 'em.
* Volcanoes too?
* Check for memory leaks.
* Color tint magnitude?
* Maybe to a z-camera instead of push back -- right now it screws visibility.
* Smooth scrolling when tabbing between quakes.


DONE:
* Use arrow keys to tab around quakes, sorted by longitude.
* Optimize the globe-rendering code.
* Make some epicenter-y graphics for quake badges.
